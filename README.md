# UnorthodoxGames
My repository for games implemented in unconventional formats
# Eligible games for this repository
Any instances of games, whether they're original games or otherwise, that are designed or created to be playable in unusual formats. E.g DOOM's various ports over the years. If there is no primary source to the game, secondary sources like Youtube videos will be used in its place.
# Game categories
## DOOM
Any and all instances of DOOM ports. DOOM merits its own section as there are numerous instances today and likely more to come in the future.

## Everything else
Various assorted games that can be played in non-typical formats. They will be sorted below a sub-heading denoting the creator's official name. If it is a game port, and the name of the original link isn't self-evident, then the name of the game will be added to the entry.
