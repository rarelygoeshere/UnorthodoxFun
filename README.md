# UnorthodoxGames
My repository for games implemented in unconventional formats
# Eligible games for this repository
Any instances of games, whether they're original games or otherwise, that are designed or created to be playable in unusual formats. E.g DOOM's various ports over the years. If there is no primary source for the game, secondary sources like YouTube videos will be used in their place.
# Game categories
## DOOM
Any and all instances of DOOM ports. DOOM merits its own section as there are numerous instances today and likely more to come.
